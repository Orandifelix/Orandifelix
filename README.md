# 👋 Hello World,

#### I’m Orandi, a Fullstack Software Engineer and Customer Success Strategist. I focus on aligning technology with user needs by tackling challenges in both back-end and front-end development—crafting intuitive interfaces and optimizing server-side logic. For me, every line of code is an opportunity to enhance user experiences and drive impact. I believe in the power of collaboration and open communication to create meaningful software solutions.
